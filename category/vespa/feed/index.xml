										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Difference Between Vespa And Scooter</strong> &#8211; Vespa has been diversifying their scooter line between small frame and large frame models since the 1960s. We&#8217;re going to take an in-depth, side-by-side look at two Vespas scooters: a large frame and a small frame. I will guide you in the difference in size, weight, handling, power, braking, seat height and the other characteristics that distinguish the two Vespa chassis.</p>
<p>What are the differences between a small frame and a large frame and Vespa? The Vespa with the small frame is usually a bit longer, narrower and lighter than the Vespa with the larger frame. On the other hand, larger frame sofas generally cost more, but they come with more power and long-distance performance, more parts and luxury features, and better brakes and road comfort. Unfortunately, the difference in seat height between small frame and large frame additions can be negligible.</p>
<h2>Difference Between Vespa And Scooter</h2>
<p>Those are the differences at a glance, but I go into more detail in this video tutorial, which will give you an idea of ​​the size and difference between today&#8217;s small frame Vespa and today&#8217;s large frame Vespa when you see them side by side. More. If you are not a fan of &#8220;backyard videos&#8221; you can simply read the full article below to better understand the difference between the two Vespa chassis.</p>
<h3>Moped Vs Scooter: What&#8217;s The Difference?</h3>
<p>Since the 1960s, Vespa has been using two main frame chassis on which they build all their vehicles. Whether you&#8217;re buying a GTS, Primavera, Sprint, GTV, LX, PX, S, or any other type of Vespa made in the last 50 years, they&#8217;re all small frames, or big frames.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t have another Vespa on the side to compare it to, don&#8217;t worry. Here&#8217;s a quick cheat sheet to help you determine if your Vespa is a small frame or large frame.</p>
<p>And popular sofas for small frame: PK series, ET series, Primavera series, Modern Sprint series, LX series, S series, etc.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, if your Vespa weighs 300 lbs or less, it&#8217;s a small frame. Over 300 lbs, may be a large frame.</p>
<h3>Vespa / Scooter</h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re not sure, leave a comment and tell me what you have and I&#8217;ll get back to you, usually within a few hours!</p>
<p>Given that Vespas have been differentiating their scooters between large and small frames for over 50 years, this question gets asked (and answered) a lot. I noticed that most answers never covered the full bike, usually just a few features here and there. I also noticed that most videos never really showed the two side by side, and if they did, it was usually taken from three, far away.</p>
<p>Size, weight, performance, fit and finish, functional options and quality of parts will all vary depending on the Vespa frame you choose. My goal is to do a thorough test between the two bikes that will cover all the differences and give you the same experience you would get if you were at a Vespa dealership.</p>
<p>With the two bikes placed evenly next to each other, it is clear that the large frame is 3 inches taller than the small frame. It&#8217;s also clear that the large bezel insert is anywhere from 1&#8243; to several inches wider than the small bezel insert, depending on where you measure from.</p>
<h3>Vespa Scooters: Reviews, Prices, Photos, And Videos</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ll talk about the extra length and wider wheelbase you&#8217;ll get later in this comparison, so read on for more details on that. Keep in mind that while the Vespas we&#8217;re looking at are different models over the years, Vespa has stayed true to their small frame and big frame chassis for quite some time, so this article will continue to work well into the 2020s.</p>
<p>If you look hard enough, you can see that the handlebars of the Vespa with a large frame can be slightly higher than the handlebars of the Vespa with a small frame. When you combine this with the overall size difference between the large and small frame additions, you might think that the seat height on the small frame would be lower, but that&#8217;s not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>The seat height in our small-frame Vespa was only 0.5 inches (1.25 cm) lower than the seat height in our large-frame Vespa. The most important thing for short riders is the shape of the seat: a wide seat stretches the legs too far, making it difficult to contact the ground .The 1 inch narrow seat brings your feet closer to the floor.</p>
<p>Seat, if you just want to change the aesthetics of your scooter, Vespa seats are usually interchangeable within the same frame and generation. For example, you can swap the GTV seats with the GTS seats since they are both large frames, and you can swap the S and LX seats since they are both small frames.</p>
<h3>Vespa Et Series</h3>
<p>Small frame sofas like the LX, Primavera and Sprint can weigh 100 pounds less than large frame sofas like the GTS and GTV. In Big vs. Small frame comparison, our small frame Vespa S series bikes weighed around 240kg (dry), as opposed to our large frame GTS weighing around 350kg (dry).</p>
<p>It is important to note that the inserts with a large frame are not particularly heavy. If we compare our Vespa GTS 300 with a 300 cc motorcycle like the Honda CB300R, the Honda weighs 315 kg, about 35 kg less than the GTS. At 240 kg dry, i.e. without fluids, small frames are simply efficient More in everything related to weight.</p>
<p>Wheelbase is the distance between the axis of the front wheel, and the axis of the rear wheel. All things being equal, the shorter the wheelbase, the stronger and more responsive the handling. If you&#8217;re new to the automotive technology conversation, think of it this way: imagine changing lanes while driving in a truck or station wagon, then imagine changing lanes in a smart car. Which one is softer?</p>
<p>There is about a 3 inch difference between the wheelbase of a large frame Vespa and the wheelbase of a small frame Vespa. Obviously this means that surviving in harsh conditions helps add to the small frame. However, the long wheelbase is not always a bad thing. At highway speeds, a longer wheelbase can help make large-framed Vespas feel more planted on the road.</p>
<h3>A Quick History Of The Vespa</h3>
<p>Again, compared to other 300cc motorcycles, we should note that the Vespa GTS300 from our comparison isn&#8217;t quite a stretch limousine. It has a 53.9&#8243; (1,375mm) wheelbase, which is still comparable to the 53.2&#8243; wheelbase &#8216; (1, 352 mm) of the Honda CB300R.</p>
<p>The engine is a big difference between small frame and large frame Vespas. The average Small frame Vespa can reach up to 14 horsepower, while the average Large frame can reach up to 21 horsepower. That&#8217;s 1.5 times more power.</p>
<p>The difference is based on the engine changes. Small frame vespas only have room for small engines, therefore a small frame vespa can have different types of engines from 50 cc to 150 cc engine size. With a large and spacious seat, the Vespa with a large frame can fit cars from 125cc to 300cc.</p>
<p>All the extra engine size change on the large-frame Vespa means it can reach 80 miles per hour (130 km/h), while the small-frame Vespa can only reach 62 miles per hour (100 km/h).</p>
<h4>Coolest New Commuter Scooters For Every Price Range</h4>
<p>The top speed of the fast 150cc small-frame Vespa is still enough for all over town, but on highways with 60 mph speed limits, you won&#8217;t have the speed left to get yourself out of trouble. For this reason, I recommend sticking to the roads With a speed limit of no more than 50 miles per hour on the Small Frame Vespa, if you want to go touring, you&#8217;ll need the high speed and power of a large frame Vespa.</p>
<p>Speed, power and top speed are only good things if you have the brakes to back them up. So which Vespa has the better brakes, the Big Frame or Small Frame Vespas?</p>
<p>Brakes on paper definitely like the Vespa with a big frame. While both small-frame and large-frame Wasps usually have a front disc brake, the small-frame Wasps come with a rear drum brake that won&#8217;t work as well as a large-frame rear disc brake.</p>
<p>Also, the new Large frame additions come equipped with ABS sensors on both the front and rear brakes. Some new small-frame Vespas only come with one ABS sensor on the front wheel, not the rear, so while the dealer may tell you it has ABS (which technically isn&#8217;t a lie), your small-frame won&#8217;t be a true full ABS system.</p>
<h2>Piaggio Vespa Elettrica (2019</h2>
<p>That said, it&#8217;s not bad for small frames. The small frame may have more basic braking technology, but it comes with proven reliability, and we don&#8217;t forget that the small frames weigh about 100 pounds less. This means they have less suspension weight. So small frame braking is still good and shouldn&#8217;t scare you.</p>
<p>Some add-ons have enough space under the seat</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Comparison Between Vespa And Activa</strong> &#8211; OTR Mumbai Price: Rs. 57, 270/- (Suzuki Swish), Rs. 62, 276 &#8211; 67, 540/- (Honda Activa 125), Rs. 72-82, 000/- (Piaggio Vespa)</p>
<p>There is no denying the fact that the 125cc segment is growing strong and fast. Suzuki made a big splash with the Access and then followed it up with something lighter, sleeker and swish. Mobility hungry customers picked up the scooter and enjoyed the performance and km/l figures as compared to the 110cc segment scooters. The Piaggio Vespa came with a very powerful 125cc engine with a 3-valve design that blew away the competition in terms of performance. Honda finally joins the bandwagon saying they are ready for 125cc scooters with the Activa 125 after exploring the market. Honda is a well-known brand that has broken all kinds of myths about two-wheeler sales in the country. , will the Activa 125 destroy the existing scooters? Or will this Honda scooter add volume to the brand? We found that after digging and running back to show you exactly what the cooking is like here.</p>
<h2>Comparison Between Vespa And Activa</h2>
<p>Motor Quest: Suzuki entered the 125cc segment in 2007 with the Access. In the year 2012 came the Swish and the Vespa 125. Honda Activa 125 is the latest in this segment.</p>
<h4>Homemade Electric Honda Activa Can Attain A Top Speed Of 65 Kmph</h4>
<p>Design &#8211; The Piaggio Vespa is miles ahead of its two competitors when it comes to the marks received in the workshop. Cool, comfortable, eye-catching, sporty (in the S avatar), call it what you want, but it&#8217;s always in the top of mind because of its retro look with a hint of modern touch. Vespa embodies a 21st century look at what a consumer wants in a scooter. Now, comparing the Swish and the Activa, the Swish wins due to its sleek and low profile with a monotonous design. From the flow indicators and stoplight to the large side panel, the Activa 125 is ahead of the curve and is a mere copy of the Hero Maestro in many ways. The Maestro looks bold, but the Activa doesn&#8217;t cut the mustard for us with those flat sides, workaholic grab rail and cheesy front-end.</p>
<p>The Suzuki Swish has its flaws, too bad steel wheels and a section that doesn&#8217;t suit this design. The Honda Activa 125 has a good wheel and a rear end. Overall, we see that Vespa wins in the styling round, but when you compare the two Japanese, the Swish beats the Activa. Honda gets it wrong once in a blue moon, and now they&#8217;ve got it.</p>
<p>Activa 125&#8217;s instrument cluster is better than Swish and better than Vespa.</p>
<p>Instrument cluster and variables &#8211; the tide has turned, the sun has set and the moon has risen. The one who fell behind, soon reached the shore. The Activa 125 has an excellent instrument cluster with red colored instrument cluster, well-chosen gauges, digital meter for odometer, trip meter and fuel gauge. Like most performance bikes, you get a needle love in the Activa. Honda spent a lot of time on the instrument cluster, and it paid off handsomely. The one on the Vespa S is also good, but there is a die-cast panel on top of the standard hood found on the Vespa LX and VX. The Vespa has a digital display that shows the clock and other things like the light indicator and side indicators. Now when we come to the swish, it is not considered and the team gets a 0/10. The blue background, the funny needle and the different choice of fonts without any separate symbols earn it the &#8220;ugly&#8221; name.</p>
<h2>Honda Activa Outsells The Hero Motocorp Splendor In September</h2>
<p>Comfortable – These scooters have long, wide and comfortable seats. The cushioning on the Activa 125 is on the soft side. The Activa is the smallest in the range at 18 litres, the Vespa at 21 liters and the Swish at 20 litres. The mirrors are well placed on all three scooters. What sets the Vespa apart from others is that it is raised, giving it better maneuverability in the city, especially when making U-turns. The Vespa comes with DC lights as standard, which no other scooter in India offers. The Activa is slightly raised, but the Swish has the same setup as other scooters, and all these scooters are easy to ride. and light in the city.</p>
<p>Performance &#8211; All scooters have 125cc air-cooled engines and that&#8217;s where the similarities end. The Vespa has a 3-valve engine while the Activa and Swish have 2-valve engines. The Vespa is the most powerful on paper, producing 10.06 bhp of power and 10.6 Nm of torque at a higher rpm than its Japanese rivals. The Honda produces 8.6 bhp at 6500 rpm and 10.12 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm while the Swish produces 8.58 bhp at 7000 rpm and 9.8 Nm of torque at 5500 rpm. In terms of the engine&#8217;s feel, the swish is flawless and there&#8217;s nothing in it that feels like it&#8217;s moving. It produces torque and power smoothly, but the acceleration is insane, and Suzuki has given us a sense of speed/fun to ride a scooter.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Activa 125 is a major controversy in terms of technical performance. The tread and feel of the pants was not what I expected, but it was fine. Vespa on the other hand is as old as ever. A little weepy but not too annoying. Women who ride this scooter say &#8220;this scooter is good too&#8221;. The power to weight ratio of the Vespa king is a significant difference, but the Japanese aren&#8217;t far behind. As you can see, the Vespa is the most powerful of the lot, but it is not the fastest of the lot, registering a VBOX time of 8.6 seconds for the run 0-60 km / h, while the Activa does it in 8.01 seconds. Swish does it in 8.5 seconds. How can you ask? The engine sound changes dramatically. The Vespa lacks the amazing low-end punch of the Activa or the Swish.</p>
<p>Now, the swish is king, but the Activa 125 with an extra .1bhp of power and .4Nm of torque (all the power and torque comes at a lower rpm) than before little. Top speeds are recorded on these scooters with the help of our VBOX tester. Swish and Vespa run at 92 kmph and Activa 87 kmph. Why do you ask this blasphemy? Vespa and Activa 125 are new engines, they take time to open and they do after service. When it&#8217;s all done, we think the Vespa will be miles ahead when it comes to top speeds, while the Swish and Activa are almost neck and neck due to its focus on the high power. We expect the acceleration time on the Vespa and Activa to improve after the first service, but only marginally. The Swish and Vespa are our long-range scooters and return a fuel economy of 45-47 km/l, while the Activa 125 maintains very similar mileage figures. The Vespa has the largest fuel tank of any scooter in India (8.5 liters), while both scooters have smaller fuel tanks (6-liter), giving it a higher level.</p>
<h3>Bs6 Honda Activa 6g Vs Tvs Jupiter Classic</h3>
<p>Riding Dynamics &#8211; Let us be very simple here. Vespa and Activa tires are better but the Swish is better. Activa and Swish engine are used as important members. Coming to the Vespa, the Italian scooter has a good chassis but the suspension is dead on. Anything above low speed, cornering the Vespa becomes difficult and starts to threaten to throw you. High stability is good up to 70 km/h, but the speed increases significantly, thanks to the soft suspension at the front, and finally the rear starts bouncy as the speed increases. Changing lanes at high speed is suicidal. The Suzuki Swish is not only drivable because of the engine, but it has telescopic forks and a good fork from day one. The front is very stiff and the rear spring rate is very soft. Take swish corners and sweepers with confidence</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Vespa As Kecil</strong> &#8211; , Jakarta &#8211; Someone can love their vehicle for various reasons. The same goes for Vespa riders. Moreover, Vespa riders seem to be the group that least thinks about the latest motorbikes with the latest technology. This is proof of how much they love Vespa.</p>
<p>The love of Vespa fans for their rides has its pros and cons. Therefore, unlike most people who love their vehicle only for its advantages, Vespa riders also love this iconic Italian motorcycle for its flaws. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this? Here&#8217;s the review.</p>
<h2>Vespa As Kecil</h2>
<p>The superiority of the Vespa can be seen from the mirrors or the engine. In terms of the engine, there are many reasons that make the Vespa superior to the others. In general, Vespa engines are simpler and more durable. The 2-stroke engine was simple enough that it only took a short time for people to understand its mechanics.</p>
<h3>First Impression Vespa Lx 125 I Get, Si Tawon Yang Mengesankan</h3>
<p>Vespa is also famous for its strong and spontaneous appeal. Not only that, because it is a gear system without a chain intermediary, the Vespa has great power so it has a strong incline. Another advantage that can be obtained is a more stable engine cooling system.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, riding a Vespa will certainly make someone the center of attention. This is also what makes it difficult for someone to switch from Vespa. Not to mention the many communities or lovers, so Vespa riders will have no trouble sharing their stories, even getting help when their ride breaks down on the road.</p>
<p>**The Sianjur earthquake destroyed the earth in Pasundan, let&#8217;s relieve the suffering of our brothers and sisters in Chanjur together by donating through: BCA Account No: 500 557 2000 A.N Pundi Amal Peduli Kasih Foundation. Assistance will be provided in the form of groceries, health services, tents, etc. Our concern is their hope.</p>
<p>Refer to. For example, in terms of wind settings, the classic Vespa does not have a standard reference, it even changes for each motorcycle. Likewise with other components such as the ignition system, especially those that still use platinum.</p>
<h2>Vespa, Inspirasi Sepeda Anak Kecil</h2>
<p>Another problem is that the engine is quite complex, especially when it comes to the clutch. To replace the clutch, for example, the rear tire must be opened. Because the location of the clutch bowl is in it. However, it can really be a special treat for Vespa lovers.</p>
<p>Iron, the Vespa became susceptible to rust. If there is a lot of rust, then the unique appearance of the Vespa can be reduced and not pleasing to the eye. Rust on the Vespa can be overcome by painting. In addition, the Vespa must be completely dry after washing.</p>
<p>Also pay attention to the looseness of the rubber, because usually excess water will remain in the loose rubber and eventually cause rust. Vespa can also be equipped</p>

<p>The Vespa 98 soon made its public debut at the Milan Auto Show, and two versions of the Vespa 98cc were introduced later, with the most expensive variant packing a speedometer (yes, it was a luxury back then) on the one hand. Stand up and white wheels on the wall. In its first year of production at the Pontedera plant, the Vespa 98 found about 2,500 buyers. The next year that number increased to over 10,000 and the following year to nearly 20,000. By 1953, more than 170,000 Vespas were on the road, and the company licensed manufacturers in other countries to assemble and sell their own version of the scooter. Over 500,000 units were sold in the first decade of Vespa production.</p>
<p>Touring Rome with Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck, Vespa quickly gained popularity. In the early 1960s, other film stars of the time such as Marlon Brando and Dean Martin also appeared on screen riding a Vespa, and by then the scooter had featured in more than 60 films, which makes Tino have more appeal to the masses. Which is already an attractive scooter.</p>
<p>For India, the Vespa originated in the form of the Sprint, which was produced here under license from Bajaj Auto in the 1960s.

However, the Bajaj and LML versions of the Vespa found many buyers, and the Bajaj Chetak in particular became an icon of motoring in India.</p>
<p>Over time, Vespa introduced new models with bigger engines &#8211; growing up to 200cc &#8211; and modern facilities. In 1984, Vespa introduced the PK 125 Automatica, which, as the name suggests, did away with the clutch lever and foot-operated brake, bringing an automatic transmission to the popular scooter for the first time. By the late 1980s, more than 10 million Vespas had been sold.</p>

<p>However, things went from bad to worse for the famous Italian manufacturer in the 1990s, as Piaggio&#8217;s ownership changed &#8211; from the Agnelli family (which owns the Fiat car) to Morgan Grenfell Private Equity . By 2003, Piaggio was on the brink of bankruptcy and resigned to the pages of history. It was saved by the Italian businessman Roberto Colignano, who invested 100 million euros and intended to give the Vespa a new life.</p>

<p>Focusing on maintaining the shape and silhouette of Vespa&#8217;s signature, Piaggio introduced new versions starting in 2005 – including the 250 cc GTS model – as well as the LX, which continues to be sold today, albeit with some changes. Vespa has gone from strength to strength in the following years, even attracting the attention of the fashion industry, Emporio Armani teamed up with Piaggio to create a limited edition of the iconic Vespa 946 scooter in 2013. Interestingly, this special edition 946 has come to India, and is priced at Rs 12 lakh (ex-showroom) &#8211; a price</p>

<p>Description Vespa 150 Sportique 1961 &#8211; 26th April Guaranteed draw for Monday 26 April, regardless of ticket sales!</p>
<h4>Vespa Scooter Cookie Cutter</h4>
<p>We are thrilled to list our beautiful 1961 Vespa Douglas 150 sportique, finished in stunning blue! omg Finally someone will win our great scooter with a beautiful history behind it &#8230; but you have to promise to take care of it and love it forever. Haha.</p>
<p>So our little scotch was kept in the UK as Douglas owner for many years until it was put to rest. We have some photos that were found to look sad for themselves in a dry shed about 20 years ago. Originally the 595EOK at the time, but the V5 and the law were lost for many years and since then it has been beautifully restored for private collectors but not registered so it sits in place Shown in the office for the whole world saw.</p>
<p>The quality is outstanding and you immediately win the program with Matt finished body in I-paint, not orange peel! Engine repair by Danny in the Midlands so it was well put together. Stay on the 8 &#8220;wheels and run 150cc and start and run like a Swiss watch!</p>
<p>So without registering for a long time, I took the challenge and registered it before you asked for a few tries to keep the old plate, but it was given a new rule that often happens along with the V5. New and complete documents and certificates and some nice new metal license plates .. not cheap ebay!</p>

<p>I will definitely miss this Aspire HQ as it has been ours since the second lock, but it&#8217;s time for us to let someone put a few miles on this beautiful Vespa Sportique and maybe slip it in. In the cozy living room she enjoys the casual. Chat and not too cold in temperature and like the window view. So maybe it&#8217;s your turn to get lucky with the previous winner &#8230; or maybe it&#8217;s your turn anyway, but good luck to you scooter fans and be careful we&#8217;ll review as Regularly mention the winners or join us for a summer motorcycle race!</p>

<p>Stanton underwent breast augmentation surgery in February 2018 and made a big reveal the following May. &#8220;Let&#8217;s not make it weird, okay?&#8221; She told fans through her Instagram story.</p>
<p>Girardi posed for a photo shoot in a bikini to show off the results of her many surgeries, including liposuction. &#8220;It took about eight weeks for the swelling to go down, [but] now I&#8217;m thin again!&#8221; she said</p>
<p>The Bachelorette season 5 had a rhinoplasty in 2012 due to bullying. &#8220;Some people are bad. I&#8217;ve found the best way to deal with it is to just feel sorry for them,&#8221; she wrote on her website in January 2015. &#8220;How many emotionally wonderful people will hop on the old world wide web and drool over someone they have . . . never met? Not many. So if someone says you&#8217;re fat, you have a sausage nose (yes, it happened and yes, I had a rhinoplasty because of it), choose the path of empathy instead of anger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alum admitted in May 2017 that she underwent breast augmentation. &#8220;I do!!!! 5 years ago!!&#8221; she tweeted then. &#8220;and I&#8217;m proud of it&#8221;.</p>
<h2>Alec Baldwin Talks About &#8216;ben Steele&#8217; While Sitting In Billings</h2>
<p>. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to do with these yet,&#8221; she joked in a preview of the spin-off.</p>
<p>Waters was open with Bachelor Nick Viall about her breast augmentation during the 21st season. The duo even sang &#8220;Happy Boob Day&#8221; to celebrate the anniversary of her implants. I started to compare the expansion of the conference to the movie Spaceballs when I said that whoever expands to 16 groups &#8220;will be checkered&#8221;. Then I said the Pac-10 presidents who allow expansion are like the Dark Helmet when they say they&#8217;re going to have to go crazy fast trying to catch the Lone Star. Now that all of this is happening, we&#8217;ve reached breakneck speed and who knows if we&#8217;ll all end up headfirst into the dashboard and need a five minute break or something.</p>
<p>And then I thought, let&#8217;s make it super geeky and figure out who would be who if everyone in the Spaceballs was a land grab character to expand the college. That&#8217;s as much as I can think of, but feel free to add a few more in the comments. And remember: you&#8217;re watching now, sir. Everything that happens now happens now.</p>

<p>Buy it now &#8211; Piaggio VESPA ET4 125cc Crankshaft / Crankshaft Add to watch list Added to watch list More power through more torque and/or more speed? Power is equal to torque times the speed at which this torque is delivered. So how do racing engines achieve such high power? This is possible only by increasing the torque or speed of torque application.</p>
<p>If you want to recalculate this formula using your scooter, you still need to bring the units of measurement to a common denominator. This formula is valid if the velocity is given in non-conventional dimensions of rad/s. One should know that a minute is a minute. You must know that one minute is 60 seconds and one round is 6.28 rad. If we assume a maximum torque of 15 Nm at 6000 rpm, this is the effect:</p>
<p>1Nm/s = 1W, 1000W = 1kW, so the Vespa motor described here has an output of 9.4kW * 1.36 = 12.8bhp at 6000rpm.</p>
<h4>Vespa Crank Cutting Question — Moped Army</h4>
<p>More or less torque is obtained from displacement. There are upper limits to torque, because at best the entire cylinder volume can be filled with a mixture of gasoline and fresh air and burned at each stroke of the piston (turbocharging, nitrous oxide or similar). All we can do is make sure all the components match up well so that the cylinder is as full as possible and the displacement is as large as possible. And this is only possible with more punching and more drilling. More stroke from longer shafts and more bores from adjustable cylinders. Output torque speed is another variable that can be used to increase power. If this is doubled, the force is also doubled. Racing engines are revved up because they have to burn multiple cylinder charges at the same time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to rev as much as possible with lighter weights and stiffer compression springs, because you&#8217;ll have a hard time making power in the high rev range.</p>
<p>For optimal cylinder filling at high engine speeds, the mixture must flow through the overflow ports as quickly as possible, and this works best if the crankcase pressure is as high as possible when the overflow valves open. Since this pressure is greater the lower the crank volume ratio between the upper and lower piston positions, the dead volume (volume of air in the crank) is tried to be as small as possible. This is achieved, among other things, by cranks with full crank paths that fill the crankcase as much as possible. However, it is possible to overdo the dead space removal game, as there is an optimal level of pre-compression. If this value is exceeded, the negative effects will prevail and the performance of the engine will decrease instead of increasing. In addition to the solid type shaft, there are a number of other types of shafts in the tuning department, each of which is optimized for a specific purpose.</p>
<p>Flow-optimized lip-and-bell (or mushroom) shafts—as a further development of the solid-spec shaft—are suitable for direct-inlet or diaphragm engines. The shape of the cheeks does not obstruct the flow of incoming gas unnecessarily and creates a larger usable cover volume. So the pre-compression is somewhat reduced, more fresh gas can flow through it and a higher degree of filling is achieved. This interaction enables a wider speed range and the achievable power is increased.</p>

<p>Rotary valve drivers, on the other hand, like to use racing edge shafts or long shafts. In addition to the significantly longer consumption time, which has a positive effect on the filling rate, the racing axles also have smooth and polished crank paths that reduce turbulence and stalling. Newer racing blade shafts for rotary wing engines also have the same advantages as diaphragm blade shafts.</p>
<p>Quality shafts are characterized by good balancing (see under &#8220;perfect balance&#8221;) and high concentricity &#8211; i.e. without &#8220;bumping&#8221; in one direction &#8211; (= directional shaft). This makes them especially smooth.</p>
<p>For the high-end small frame engines, the crankshaft is offered with a diameter of 87 mm (instead of the original 82 mm). These provide greater security against twisting, as there is more material on top of the pin and therefore the dimensions of the press can be chosen higher. However, the crankshaft should be cranked up to 88mm.</p>
<p>When we use the term &#8220;balanced&#8221; we mean &#8220;balanced 12 o&#8217;clock&#8221; or &#8220;static balance&#8221;. The connecting rod eye moves outward at 12 o&#8217;clock (top) when the axle is free and suspended horizontally. All rotating masses are 100% balanced using balancing holes. Pistons, rings, pins, etc. are &#8220;counter&#8221; transmission masses. Unfortunately, the entire system can never be 100% balanced, which is why there is no vibration-free 1-cylinder engine. This is related to the acceleration and deceleration at dead centers and with the eccentricity of masses in between.</p>

<p>Dynamic balance means that the entire system, including pistons and shafts, will be balanced. Unfortunately, the effort is not feasible in practice. In effect, one tries to balance the piston and shaft well, which is described by the &#8220;balance factor&#8221;. It describes the weight ratio between rotating and oscillating (translational) masses. Experience shows that the amount of approx. 40% give good results.</p>
<p>Longer strokes are obtained by placing the crankshaft further from the axis of rotation of the crankshaft. This effect can be achieved, for example, with an unusual wood. 1mm more off-axis means 2mm more impact. Then the piston moves 1 mm from top dead center and 1 mm below bottom dead center. A 1 mm thicker base or head gasket should be installed to prevent the piston from hitting the head. In addition, the piston skirt should be shortened slightly at the bottom so that it does not hit the housing at bottom dead center. However, time will change.</p>
<p>Compensation with foot seal: exhaust time is longer, overflow time is significantly longer. If the exhaust is also slightly raised with a mill, the engine is optimized for higher speeds.</p>
<p>Compensation with head gasket: exhaust and overflow time is only slightly longer &#8211; thus the overflow time changes more than the exhaust time (= less pre-emission). Optimized for more torque at medium engine speeds.</p>
